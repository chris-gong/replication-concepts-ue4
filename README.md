# Replication Concepts in Unreal Engine
This project goes over various topics in replication using C++ in Unreal Engine. Unreal's networking model is an "authoritative server, dumb client" model, in which the server has the correct version of the world and all of its actors. The state of these actors is then sent to the clients. For more information on this, consider checking out my introductory video to replication: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0Ltr130oVE
